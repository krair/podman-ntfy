# podman-ntfy
Companion repo for the script described in https://rair.dev/podman-update-notifications-ntfy/

The script is described in the above-linked article. The article is meant to be educational, thus, there is lots of variability with how you'd like the script to run. This is mostly just an example.

Note that the default Ntfy server in the script is the official one - change it to your self-hosted version if you have one. And the topic is meant to be changed by you.
